# RpgForFun

**myLittleRPG** is an exercice from *Lecture 49 - iOS 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional*. 
I will show all different steps to create my solution of the case study proposed by Mark Price.
Indeed, there are plenty of improvements regarding the exercice. The core goal is to understand the core concepts of object oriented programming.

## TABLE OF CONTENT
* I. Compability
* II. Assets
* III. Design requirements
* IV. Extra notes

## I. Compability
This app has been made for iOS and has been tested Xcode 7.3 (Swift 2.2) as well as on iPhone (9.3.1). It is optimized for an iPhone 5s in landscape mode.

## II. Assets
* Graphic assets : From Mark Price's course. Some have been edited.
* Audio assets (all credits are in the AudioGame.swift file) : ![here] (https://github.com/devzenx/RpgForFun/blob/master/docs/RpgForFun_Audio.assets.zip)

## III. Design requirements

#### Flowchart
![myLittleRPG - Flowchart](https://github.com/devzenx/RpgForFun/blob/master/docs/images/myLittleRPG.flowchart.jpg)

#### Implementation priorities :
- (A) This feature is essential to the program. Without it, the user cannot fully use the program.
- (B) This feature is not mandatory but having it can prevent some programs flaws. They also stronly improve the selling values of the program (usability, restrictions, etc.).
- (C) These features are not critical but can improve the overal aspect of the program. 

**ï¿¬ FEATURES LIST NEEDS TO BE UPDATED**
